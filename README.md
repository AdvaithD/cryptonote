CryptoNote
==========

CryptoNote is a very simple open source web application that lets users encrypt and share arbitrary messages.

### Ruby version
CryptoNote requires ruby version 2.0.0 or higher.

### System dependencies
You will have to install Postgres locally in order to run this. Unfortunately, the Heroku Postgres App is currently not supported as it does not have support for the `uuid-ossp` extension required to generate UUIDs.
